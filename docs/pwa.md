# PWA setup

## Goal
Use Microsoft Teams without installing native clients.

## How (Chromium / Firefox)

1. Open Teams in browser.
2. Use browser menu:
   - "Install app" / "Create shortcut"
   - Enable "open as window"

3. Pin the resulting app/window.

## Notes
- Notifications depend on browser permissions.
- Screen sharing works inconsistently.
- This is still better than native clients.
